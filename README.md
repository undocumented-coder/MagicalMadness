 I've created an official website for the project, powered by ReactJS & Mantine.

 Added a compiler I wrote!! Currently a tree walking interpreter with an LL(1) tail recursive parser. It supports the following operations: unary, negate, increment (not in parser though), decrement (not yet in parser either), parenthesis, and + - * / ^ % and C++ function calling, all with operator precedence implemented so that the math will match a calculators output. This language is a hybrid between lua and C++ because I enjoy both languages and thought it'd be fun to make a mix.

 Linked up all the components together and added exception handling for finding errors easier.
 
 [1/17/23]
 Implemented Zydis disassembler.
 Adding graphical disassembled output later today.
 Also going to reshape code a bit, look for bugs, and add actual functionality.
